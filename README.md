#Model Development for One Day Ahead Wind Speed Prediction
The goal of the project is to develop a statistical model to predict one day ahead wind speed.
Wind prediction is important for both energy and environment concerns. As a renewable energy, the main challenge in implementing it into the grid is the intermittency, which could bring a lot of problems such as market designs, real-time grid operations, capacity of transmission system, energy storages planning and scheduling, and optimal reductions in greenhouse gas emissions of entire power system.  With regard to atmospheric environment, wind speed, direction, and air temperature gradients interact with the physical features of the landscape to determine the movement and dispersal of air pollutants, which are related to health and regulation issues.  If future wind information could be accurately predicted, many of these problems could be overcome and/or addressed. For instance, a good wind speed forecast can help to develop well-functioning hour-ahead or day-ahead markets. As for air quality, the potential impact on nearby regions caused by some certain air pollution sources at different locations can be evaluated by using future wind data.
In general, time-scale of wind prediction could be classified into four categories, shown in Table 1.
